  "description": "AutomaBotania was an attempt to make Botania easier to automate. I could later realise this when I helped MelanX with botanical machinery. Actually the way these machines look was mostly planned when I planned AutomaBotania. At this point: A huge thank you to MelanX as he brought me back to modding and without him I would have stopped again three times.",
